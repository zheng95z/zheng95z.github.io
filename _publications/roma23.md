<p style="text-align:center; font-style:italic;">ROMA wasn't built in a day, but in 0.x milliseconds!</p>

## What is ROMA?

ROMA (Ray-aligned Occupancy Map Array) is a ray tracing alternative, which is fast to build and fast to trace: building ROMA only requires one pass of rasterization; tracing ray against ROMA only takes O(1) time, without any hierarchical traversal (as opposed to Hardware Ray Tracing) and without iterations (as opposed to Distance Fields).

## Why do we need ROMA?

Hardware Ray Tracing builds fast, traces fast, but requires specific hardwares. Distance Fields traces fast, but builds prohibitively slow (3.31ms at 128^3 resolution); this is why Distance Fields are limited to static objects.

## What is the idea of ROMA?

<div style="text-align:center;">

</div>

3D scene geometries can be approximately represented by voxel bit bricks and compactly stored in a 2D occupancy map (OM).

<div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="/assets/pub/roma23_iter.png" style="max-width: 50%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

Ray tracing in OM can be fast: a group of binary voxels along z-axis can be checked at once with one texture fetch and few bit operations. But the fastest case is when tracing the ray along the z-axis (one iteration in total). Therefore, we want to make some preparation---making multiple copies of OMs with different rotations---so that every ray can be traced along z-axis.


## How does ROMA work?

<div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="/assets/pub/roma23_step1.gif" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

Step 1: build a BOM (Base Occupancy Map). This is a standard OM which can be quickly generated using rasterization.

<div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="/assets/pub/roma23_step2.gif" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

Step 2: Copy the BOM and rotate towards different directions. The best part of this step is that it does not requires any further rasterization, but only performing within a compute shader.

<div style="text-align:center;">
        <img src="/assets/pub/roma23_step3.gif" style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;"/>
</div>

Step 3: Given any ray, "snap" it to its closest rotation direction in Step 2, and perform 1D ray tracing in O(1) time by bit operations.

## Any other notes?

- ROMA is scalable between performance and quality, by tuning the resolution of BOM (spatial resolution) and the number of rotated OMs (angular resolution).
- ROMA is suitable for spatiotemporal rendering, by using differently randomized directions in Step 2 over time.
- ROMA, as a ray tracing alternative, is not a solution to any specific light transport methods, e.g., ReSTIR for direct illumination, or DDGI for indirect illumination, and so on. One should expect to use ROMA **in combination with** these methods, whenever ray tracing is needed.

## Results

The following videos compare ROMA with Distance Field (DF) and Hardware Ray Tracing (Ref.). More specificially:

- We want to show **soft shadows** from direct illumination and **color bleeding** from indirect illumination.
- Direct illumination is sampled from an area (disk) light source on the roof. All methods are sampling and tracing towards it.
- Indirect illumination is queried from a Reflective Shadow Map (RSM). All methods first tracing to get the secondary shading point, and then use it to query the RSM.
- ROMA has a spatial resolution of 128^2 and a angular resolution of 8^2.
- DF has a resolution of 128^3.
- The videos themselves do not reflect the performance, they are just 60FPS playback.

All experiments and timings are conducted on a desktop with a 3.70 GHz Interl i9-10900K and an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3080 Ti. The table reblow reports the average performance on *Morphing Spot Scene*, *Morphing Spikes Scene*, and *BrainStem Scene* (similar scene complixity):

| DF   | ~2.86 ms (3.2x) | ~0.90 ms (2.0x) | The generation of DF is slow. This is mainly due to the time complexity of the 3D Jump Flooding Algorithm.                                                                                          |
| ROMA |        ~0.89 ms |        ~0.45 ms | Compared with DF, ROMA is consistently faster in both generation and tracing. ROMA also achieves faster tracing than HWRT (~0.50ms) even without hardware acceleration!                             |
